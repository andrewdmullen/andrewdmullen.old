        		<h1>Andrew Mullen</h1>
				<h3>Senior Research Engineer, Cornell University</h3>
				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>Andrew's work focuses on applying engineering and science to develop novel tools for earth and space exploration. 
				He has over 10 years of experience on NASA and NSF technology development projects. 
				His efforts have involved designing and building instruments which integrate optics, computing, electrical engineering, and mechanical design.
				He is experienced as both member and leader teams advancing scientific tools from concept to field deployable intruments.
	
				Prior work has included: 
					- completing multiple seasons as an operations engineer for the underwater robot Icefin
					- designing and building custom underwater imaging systems, including microscopy and computational imaging  
					- creating tools for studying fluid dynamic processes
					- developing concept mission payloads for future planetary missions to "ocean worlds" such as Europa
				
				Through these projects he has had the opportunity to conduct field research in Antarctica, the Arctic,  
				on three field seasons as an operations engineer deploying the underwater robot "Icefin", and conducted field work as a 
				scientific diver. 
				
				Prior to his time at Cornell Andrew was a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) scholar at the Georgia Institute of Technology. 
				He received a Ph.D, in Electrical Engineering from the University of California San Diego, an MS in Oceanography 
				from Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and a BS in Civil Engineering from the University of Notre Dame.</a></p>
