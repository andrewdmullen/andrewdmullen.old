        		<h1>Andrew Mullen</h1>
				<h3>Senior Research Engineer, Cornell University</h3>
				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>
				Andy is a Senior Research Engineer at Cornell University. Prior to his time at Cornell he was a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) scholar at the Georgia Institute of Technology. 
				He received a PhD, in Electrical Engineering from the University of California San Diego, an MS in Oceanography from Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and a BS in Civil Engineering from the University of Notre Dame.
				<br><br>
				His work focuses on developing tools for earth and space exploration. 
				He has over 10 years of experience on NASA and NSF technology development projects, with an emphasis on building custom scientifc instruments for extreme environments. 
				In these highly interdisciplinary team efforts he has had a focus on optical and elelctical engineering, while also contributing to mechanical and software development.
				<br><br>
				Examples of past and ongoing work include: development of custom subersible imaging systems using microscopy and computational imaging, operations and development team member on the underwater robot "Icefin", development of conceptual life detection payloads for planetary missions to "ocean worlds" such as Europa.
				<br><br>
				Through these projects Andrew has had the opportunity to conduct field research in Antarctica, the Arctic, Red Sea, Carribean, and West Africa. 
				As well as work conduct research as a scientific diver, aboard research vessels, and utilizing remotely operated vehilces (ROVs). 
				Outside of work he enjoys surfing, backpacking, and endurance athletics.
