        		<h1>Andrew Mullen</h1>
				<h3>Senior Research Engineer, Cornell University</h3>
				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>Andrew's research focuses on combining science and engineering to develop novel instruments for ocean exploration. 
				His prior work has included designing and building underwater imaging systems to study micro-scale organisms and 
				fluid dynamic processes as they naturally occur in the ocean. He is additionally developing these tools for life detection 
				application on future planetary missions to "ocean worlds" such as Europa. Through this work he has traveled to Antarctica 
				on three field seasons as an operations engineer deploying the underwater robot "Icefin", and conducted field work as a 
				scientific diver. Prior to his time at Cornell he was a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) scholar at the Georgia Institute 
				of Technology. He received a Ph.D, in Electrical Engineering from the University of California San Diego, an MS in Oceanography 
				from Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and a BS in Civil Engineering from the University of Notre Dame.</a></p>
