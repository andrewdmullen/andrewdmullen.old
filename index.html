				<h3>Senior Research Engineer, Cornell University</h3>
				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>
				Andrew is a Senior Research Engineer at Cornell University. His work focuses on developing tools for earth and space exploration. 
				He has over 10 years of experience on NASA and NSF technology development projects, with an emphasis on designing and building scientifc instruments for extreme environments.
				In these efforts he has served as both a member and leader of science-engineering teams, advancing custom tools from concept to field deployable instruments.
				He has experience on multidisciplinary engineering systems; with a specific focus on optical and elelctical engineering, while also contributing to mechanical and software development.
				<br>
				Examples of prior work include: 
				* Designing and builing custom underwater imaging systems - including microscopic imaging and computational imaging 
				* Serving as a operations and development engineer with the underwater robot Icefin - involving multiple Antarctic field seasons
				* Creating tools for studying in situ fluid dynamic processes
				* Developing a conceptual mission payload for future planetary missions to "ocean worlds" such as Europa
				<br>
				Through these projects Andrew has had the opportunity to conduct field research in Antarctica, the Arctic, Red Sea, Carribean, and West Africa.
				While 
				on three field seasons as an operations engineer deploying the underwater robot "Icefin", and conducted field work as a 
				scientific diver. 
				<br>
				Prior to his time at Cornell Andrew was a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) scholar at the Georgia Institute of Technology. 
				He received a Ph.D, in Electrical Engineering from the University of California San Diego, an MS in Oceanography 
				from Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and a BS in Civil Engineering from the University of Notre Dame.
